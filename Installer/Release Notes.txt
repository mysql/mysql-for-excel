MySQL for Excel 1.3.0 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.3.0

* Added ability to select multiple tables and views and an Import Multiple Tables and Views action
  that when clicked imports the data of all selected database objects into individual Excel worksheets,
  Excel tables are created optionally for each imported Table or View. On Excel 2013 (and higher)
  PowerPivot model relationships can be created based on MySQL relationships defined with foreign key
  constraints.
* Added a new option to create Excel PivotTables for imported MySQL data, the feature is present on all
  Import Data dialogs (for Tables, Views and Procedures). The PivotTables are created next to the
  imported data so the PivotTables can be easily viewed and customized to suit users needs.
* Added new option to refresh the data on Excel tables created from imported MySQL DB objects using Excel's
  Refresh commands. Saving an Excel Workbook where Excel tables were created from imported MySQL data will
  retain the connection properties so data can be refreshed after closing and reopening the Workbook later.
* Added a new option to include a row with summary fields for imported MySQL data, the feature is present
  on all Import Data dialogs (for Tables, Views and Procedures).
* Added the ability to specify character set and collation options for new schemas created through the
  Create New Schema action label and for new tables created through the Export Excel Data to New Table action
  label. By default schemas are created using the server default character set and collation, and tables are
  created using the schema ones just as previous Excel versions worked.
* Added a new Reset to Defaults button to the Import, Export or Append advanced options and Global Options
  dialogues to allow resetting options to their default values.
* Added new advanced option to display all allowed MySQL data types in the Export Data dialog's Data Type
  combo box versus only the basic and mostly used data types that have been shown in previous versions of
  MySQL for Excel.

Known Issues
--------------------
* Upgrading from versions 1.2.0 and lower is not possible due to a bug fixed in 1.2.1. In that scenario
  the version (1.2.0 or lower) must be uninstalled first. Upgrading from 1.2.1 works correctly.
* CTRL+A cannot be used to select all DB objects, SHIFT+arrow or click or CTRL+click must be used instead.
* Excel tables created from external data sources may not refresh if MySQL for Excel add-in is loaded.
* PivotTables are normally placed to the right (skipping one column) of the imported data, they will not be
  created if there is another existing Excel object at that position.



MySQL for Excel 1.2.1 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.2.1

* Optimized the way SQL statements are sent to the server, INSERT statements for Export Data
  operations are not sent anymore as single large statements but as single INSERT statements
  for each of the data rows. In average a 30-35% time improvement was achieved.
* Optimized the way SQL queries are created for a changed row (in average a 30-40% time
  improvement), the processing of warnings returned by the SQL server and the overall creation
  of result text for errors and warnings so processing is faster and less memory is used.
* Optimized how the Excel data is loaded into a MySqlDataTable object (in average a 80% time
  improvement), so now a temporary hidden Excel worksheet is used to prepare the data to be
  loaded and then load it after it was preprocesed instead of preprocessing cell by cell as it
  was done before. The preprocessing eliminates as many blank Excel cells as possible as well.
* Added an advanced option to the Insert Data dialog to create secondary indexes after all the
  data has been inserted, this saves a lot of disk I/O for bulk inserts (thousands of rows)
  since reindexing will not happen every time a row is inserted but only once at the very end
  of the data insertion. This option is enabled by default.
* Added an advanced option to the Append Data dialog to disable unique indexes and foreign keys
  temporarily for the duration of the data insertion. This option is disabled by default since
  the user must make sure that if unique indexes are present the data mapped to that column does
  not contain duplicate data.
* Removed the 'Remove columns that contain no data, otherwise just flag them as "Excluded"' option
  in the Advanced Export Data Options dialog so now empty columns in an Excel range selected for
  an Export Data or Append Data operations are always removed. This change helps when users select
  the whole worksheet's cells or whole rows/columns for exporting or appending data.
* Other bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).


MySQL for Excel 1.2.0 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.2.0

* Added support for edition of MySQL Workbench connections right from the Welcome Panel where
  connections are shown. Any of the listed MySQL Workbench connections can be right-clicked
  and a new "Edit Connection" context menu is available for users to edit the Workbench
  connection properties. There is no longer a need to have MySQL Workbench installed in order
  to edit an existing connection.
* Added support for optimistic updates to Edit Data operations via a configurable option, using
  optimistic updates will ensure that pushing changes in the current editing session does not
  overwrite changes done by another person to the set of data retrieved initially. This option
  can be set globally for all editing sessions open by the current user which is persisted in the
  settings file, or for a specific editing session so when the session is over the optimistic
  update value is reset to the global one.
* Changes done to the Advanced Options dialogues for Import, Export and Append Data forms are now
  immediately reflected without requiring to close and reopen those forms.
* Added "Preview SQL statements before they are sent to the server" and "Show executed SQL statements
  along with their results" global options. The first option lets users preview the SQL statements
  used in an Export, Append or Edit data operation before they are sent to the MySQL server and edit
  them if needed. The second option lets users apply the statements directly and show the executed
  SQL statements after they were applied along with the results of the operations.
* Added "Allow to save active editing sessions" global option. This allows to save Edit sessions
  when saving the Excel workbook, and restoring them when the workbook is opened again.
* Added the "Create an Excel table for the imported MySQL table data" option to the Import Data
  dialog's advanced options to automatically create an Excel table object for every MySQL table
  imported to Excel so it can be used for Excel data analysis. Additionally the user can override the
  default style for the Excel table and choose one of the available styles within a drop down list.
* Added a new informational label "Schema:" to the panel "Select a Database Object" that shows the
  name of the current schema, located just below the "User:" and "IP:" labels.
* Fixed code that was not detecting an Excel row deletion but instead was detecting an Excel row
  change during an Edit Data operation.


MySQL for Excel 1.1.2 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.1.2

* Upon saving a Workbook containing Worksheets in Edit Mode, the user is asked if he
  wants to exit the Edit Mode on all Worksheets before their parent Workbook is saved
  so the Worksheets are saved unprotected, otherwise the Worksheets will remain protected
  and the users will be able to unprotect them later retrieving the passkeys from the
  application log after closing MySQL for Excel.
* Added background coloring to the column names header row of an Import Data operation
  to have the same look as the one in an Edit Data operation (i.e. gray-ish background).
* Expired passwords are checked upon connection and can be reset by the users right at
  connection time within the add-in.
* A connection test is done before doing any operation against the MySQL Server (schema
  creation, data export, append, import and edition).
* Added global options to override the default connection and query execution timeouts.
* Connection passwords can be stored securely just like MySQL Workbench does and these
  secured passwords are shared with Workbench in the same way connections are.
* Fixed bug where a backslash was inserted before apostrophes when editing a MySQL table.
* Fixed problem specific to Excel 2013 where the add-in side bar was not visible on Excel
  windows different than the first window opened.
* Fixed problem where users different to the one that installed MySQL for Excel could not
  see and use the add-in (i.e. the add-in was only installed for the current user and not
  for all users).
* Fixed problem where a failed connection was always stating that the connection password
  was wrong, now the actual failing reason for the connection failure is shown.
* Other bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).


MySQL for Excel 1.1.1 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.1.1

* Added About dialog so users can check the MySQL for Excel version right from the Welcome panel.
* Fixed formatting of decimal numbers for European users where the decimal separator is a ",".
* Fixed formatting of data on Excel cells that had data previously imported on them.
* Other bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).
	

MySQL for Excel 1.1.0 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.1.0

* Edit MySQL Data
	This may be the coolest feature so far; users will be able to edit the data in a
	MySQL table using MS Excel in a very friendly and intuitive way.  Edit Data supports
	inserting new rows, deleting existing rows and updating existing data as easy as playing
	with data in an Excel’s spreadsheet and pushing changes back to the server.
* Bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).
	
Known Issues
--------------------
* The Edit Data does not lock records and does not update data in an optimistic way, so if
  data has changed by another user in the table being edited after it was pulled for edition
  it will be overwritten with the latest change.


MySQL for Excel 1.0.7 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.0.7

* Windows Authentication is now working for both proxy & non proxy scenarios,
  for proxy use the SQL receipt like this:
	CREATE USER myuser1 IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows as 
	'machine\\\\user1=foo_user' 
	create user foo_user identified by 'pass' 
	grant all privileges on *.* to 'foo_user'@'%' 
	grant proxy on foo_user to myuser1 

  while for non proxy use a SQL receipt like this
	CREATE USER myuser1 IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows as 'myuser1, Administrators'
	grant all privileges on *.* to 'myuser1'@'%'
  where myuser1 is supposed to be a member of the Windows Administrators group.
   
  In both cases you should be able to connect, Excel addin will still ask for the password, 
  just leave it blank.


MySQL for Excel 1.0 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.0

MySQL For Excel provides the following features:
* Integrates seamlessly with Excel 2007 and 2010
* Uses the MySQL Workbench connections you have already established
* Allows importing of data from MySQL into Excel spreadsheets
* Allows appending of Excel data onto existing MySQL tables
* Allows exporting of Excel data into new MySQL tables

Known Issues
--------------------
* Seamless sync of Workbench connections is not working in this release.  
  The connections you make in MySQL for Excel will not be available in Workbench.
* Export Data dialog's preview grid can truncate some column names
* Connections cannot be edited currently.  Please use MySQL Workbench to edit your connections
* Export Data dialog can change the name of an autoadded primary key when changing first row checkbox
* Windows Authentication only works with a proxy user, for example:
	the following script can be used to implement proxy scenario: 
	CREATE USER myuser1 IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows as 
	'machine\\\\user1=foo_user' 
	create user foo_user identified by 'pass' 
	grant all privileges on *.* to 'foo_user'@'%' 
	grant proxy on foo_user to myuser1 

Then, from MySql Excel addin, a connection can be created/opened by 
@ specifying user "myuser1" and no password (assuming windows current user is 
machine\\user1).
