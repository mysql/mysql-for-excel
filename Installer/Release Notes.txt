MySQL for Excel 1.3.5 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.3.5

* Added support for JSON data type columns. The JSON data type appears now as a selectable one in the Export
  Data dialog for columns (if the advanced option to show all data types is selected). All data operations
  (Import, Export, Append and Edit) work with the new JSON data type.
- Added an option to the Advanced Options dialog for Append Data operations, called "Show column data types
  above column names", that when checked data type information for columns on source and target grids of the
  Append Data dialog is shown. Showing the data types can sometimes aid users when doing manual mapping of
  columns.
- Stopped using some hidden defined names to store formulas to transform date values into a the date format
  used by MySQL. These defined names were being detected by Excel as macros or user functions that could not
  be saved in macro-free workbooks, thus generating an annoying warning every time a Workbook was saved, if
  the add-in was active.
- Fixed a bug where connection information for ListObjects created by MySQL for Excel when importing data was
  not being saved, so after the Workbook was re-opened a COM Exception was being thrown when attempting to
  refresh the contents of those ListObects.
- Fixed code in the Append Data dialog that was incorrectly mapping columns when only a single row of Excel
  data was selected to append. Additionally validated that if a single row of Excel data is selected and then
  on the Append Data dialog "First Row Contains Column Names" is checked, a warning is displayed stating no
  rows are available to complete the append operation.
* Other bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).




MySQL for Excel 1.3.4 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.3.4

* Fixed a bug that occurred during the preparation of data to be exported to a new table, when the number of
  rows to be exported was higher than the number of previewed rows, the Export Data operation was restricted
  to the number of previewed rows.
* Fixed the import of MySQL data into an Excel range to convert any dates before the Excel minimum date
  (January 1, 1900) to text so Excel does not throw a COM Exception. Verified that these dates can be changed
  on Edit Data operations and saved back to MySQL without any errors.
* Changed the method to display a custom Save As dialog when a Workbook is saved in Excel 2007 to one that
  supports showing all Excel supported file filters.
* Fixed the custom Refresh All functionality overriden by MySQL for Excel to fire a refresh not only to Excel
  tables (ListObjects) but also to Pivot Tables.
* Fixed code used to temporarily store the selected Excel range used for an Export or Append Data operation so
  that it copies only visible rows (i.e. rows that have not been filtered out by an Excel Auto-Filter).
* Changed the way data uniqueness within a column is checked during an Export Data operation. Before MySQL for
  Excel relied in ADO.NET's way to determine if the data in a DataColumn is unique (by creating a Unique
  constraint in it), which uses SQL Server's rules and regards nulls values as duplicates even when the column
  is set to allow null data. MySQL allows to have duplicate null values in a column that is set to allow null
  data. Now MySQL for Excel follows the MySQL rules, so if a column is set to allow null data, those values are
  not considered in the uniqueness check, otherwise they do. Now if duplicate values are found when flagging a
  column as Unique, a dialog containing the sets of duplicate values along with the count of those sets can be
  displayed by clicking the More Information link shown within the column warning.
* Other bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).


Known Issues
--------------------
* Upgrading from versions 1.3.2 and lower is not possible due to a bug fixed in version 1.3.3.
  In that scenario the version (1.3.2 or lower) must be uninstalled first. Upgrading from 1.3.3 and higher works
  as expected.
  
  

MySQL for Excel 1.3.3 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.3.3

* Fixed a problem in the MySQL for Excel MSI that was not replacing the registry keys on an upgrade (registry
  keys from previous versions remained and were not upgraded) which caused the add-in to not work at all.
* Fixed the way a previewed SQL script is split into individual SQL statements using a tokenizer that detects
  each type of token within the script text, so now the delimiters for SQL statements are detected correctly.
* Fixed some bugs related to the way SQL queries are assembled during an Edit Data session and to text values.
  One of the problems was related to memory allocation for the query text overflowing when many TEXT columns
  were present in the table. Another problem was related to text values used in the WHERE clause of UPDATE
  queries were not being properly escaped, this was only happening when optimistic updates were being used.
  Optimized the construction of WHERE clauses with optimistic updates and TEXT columns to use user variables
  to store the old column values referenced in the WHERE clause to save query text space.
* Added an explicit conversion for Excel cells containing time values (stored internally as decimal numbers
  formatted as a time) to TimeSpan objects in .NET so these values are recognized in the Export Data dialog
  as time values to be exported to TIME columns in a new MySQL table. Fixed the code that assembles the
  INSERT SQL queries used to push data to a MySQL DB to wrap time values in single quotes.
* Rows involved in a commit action during Edit Data operations are refreshed from the database after the
  transaction is committed, so values that are modified at the server side (autoincrement fields,
  timestamps, or others by stored procedures) are returned to Excel after the push. This avoids the
  generation of optimistic update warnings stating the data has been changed outside the Edit Data session.
* Added code to convert TimeSpan values from the database into Excel's time values to avoid type errors while
  importing Time values to a range (when Create Excel Table option is not selected in Advanced Options).
* Fixed code to allow the usage of formulas in Excel ranges used in Export and Append Data operations.
* Changed the way columns without any data that are inside the selected Excel range are treated during an
  Export or Append data operation, in version 1.2.1 we dismissed any columns without data, now if the
  columns with no data exist between other columns that contain data they are considered as valid for
  Export or Append. Fixed a bug in the code that prepares the data for Append when the mapped columns are
  less than the total number of columns in the target table.
* Changed the way null and zero dates are handled, in previous versions MySQL null values in date columns
  and zero dates ("0000-00-00 00:00:00") were imported in Excel as "1/0/1900  12:00:00 AM", if 0 was entered
  the value was converted to "12:00:00 AM" automatically. Now that Excel ListObjects are bound to refresh
  data a possible bug in VSTO converts zero and null date values into text, not good since it messes up dates
  recognition in Excel. Now zero dates are always treated as null, so even typing a 0 in a date column
  translates to a null date. Logic that recognizes date values string or boxed objects was rewritten from
  scratch to fix also bugs with dates in a locale different than US English.
* Fixed code to generate SQL queries for Export Data operations with the right culture-invariant decimal
  delimiter (".").
* Other bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).


Known Issues
--------------------
* Upgrading from versions 1.3.2 and lower is not possible due to a bug fixed in this version (1.3.3).
  In that scenario the version (1.3.2 or lower) must be uninstalled first. Upgrading from 1.3.3 will work
  as expected.



MySQL for Excel 1.3.2 GA Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.3.2 GA

* Excel tables created from stored procedures can now be refreshed.
* New icons were introduced for SSH and Fabric Managed connections. SSH connections are still shown as
  disabled, these will be enabled in the future when SSH tunnels can be created on the fly.
* A pop-up warning message stated that some features could not be saved in a macro-free workbook would
  appear when closing a Workbook that was not saved. Internationalization formulas used by MySQL for Excel
  that are stored in Workbook Names are now removed before the Workbook is saved, and these formulas are
  added again after the save operation.
* A new global option called "Preview MySQL table data before an Edit Data session is opened" was added,
  when checked, the data of a selected MySQL table to be edited is shown in a preview dialog before the
  Edit Data session is opened. If the option is unchecked, no preview takes place and the Edit Data session
  is opened directly. This replaces the Import Data dialog being shown when starting an Edit Data session.
* A new context menu option called "Preview Data" was added, it is available when right-clicking a MySQL
  table or view listed in the DB Objects selection panel. The option opens the Preview Data dialog and shows
  by default the first 10 rows of the selected table or view.
* Controls directly related to a checkbox or radio button are given focus (and their contents selected when
  the case applies) automatically on all dialogs. This change affected the following dialogs: Import Data,
  Import Multiple Data, Export Data, Global Options, Import Advanced Options.
* When importing multiple database objects, related tables and views were only detected when the originally
  selected database object (shown at the left side of the dialog) had a MySQL Foreign Key explicitly declared,
  but they were not detected if the selected database object was actually the foreign object. In other words,
  only a 1-directional relationship was detected.
* The "Add Summary Fields" option in all Import Data dialogs now format in bold the summary row and adds a
  thick border to differentiate the summary row from data rows.
* A new drop-down was added to the Import Multiple dialog to create a PivotTable for al tables in the Excel
  Data Model if Excel Relationships are created. This enables the analysis of all tables in a single PivotTable
  report.
* Other bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).

Known Issues
--------------------
* Upgrading from versions 1.2.0 and lower is not possible due to a bug fixed in 1.2.1. In that scenario
  the version (1.2.0 or lower) must be uninstalled first. Upgrading from 1.2.1 works correctly.



MySQL for Excel 1.3.1 RC Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.3.1 RC

* When reopening a saved Excel workbook that contains imported MySQL data, MySQL for Excel attempts to
  reconnect the Excel tables with the corresponding MySQL databases where the imported MySQL data was
  imported from. If the MySQL connections are not found, then a new dialog prompts you to either ignore,
  create, or delete the missing connections. Ignore allows you to work offline, and the dialog will open
  the next time the Excel workbook is opened.
* Control + A now selects all tables and views in the "Database Objects" selection panel.
* After importing data, clicking Refresh All from the Data tab would fail to refresh the data, and it
  generated an "Initialization of the data source failed" error.
* Excel tables that contain data from a MySQL import operation can now be refreshed even if the MySQL for
  Excel side pane is not visible.
* Fixed a bug in which data could not be imported from a remote MySQL server.
* Line and LinearRing were removed from the list of valid data types, so they no longer appear in the
  Data Export data type form.
* Edit Sessions would fail to restore with sessions that contained tables with zero DATETIME values. Edit
  Sessions would also fail to restore when MySQL for Excel was started on a currently opened Excel workbook.
* Other bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).

Known Issues
--------------------
* Upgrading from versions 1.2.0 and lower is not possible due to a bug fixed in 1.2.1. In that scenario
  the version (1.2.0 or lower) must be uninstalled first. Upgrading from 1.2.1 works correctly.
* PivotTables are normally placed to the right (skipping one column) of the imported data, they will not be
  created if there is another existing Excel object at that position.



MySQL for Excel 1.3.0 Beta Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.3.0 Beta

* Added ability to select multiple tables and views and an Import Multiple Tables and Views action
  that when clicked imports the data of all selected database objects into individual Excel worksheets,
  Excel tables are created optionally for each imported Table or View. On Excel 2013 (and higher)
  PowerPivot model relationships can be created based on MySQL relationships defined with foreign key
  constraints.
* Added a new option to create Excel PivotTables for imported MySQL data, the feature is present on all
  Import Data dialogs (for Tables, Views and Procedures). The PivotTables are created next to the
  imported data so the PivotTables can be easily viewed and customized to suit users needs.
* Added new option to refresh the data on Excel tables created from imported MySQL DB objects using Excel's
  Refresh commands. Saving an Excel Workbook where Excel tables were created from imported MySQL data will
  retain the connection properties so data can be refreshed after closing and reopening the Workbook later.
* Added a new option to include a row with summary fields for imported MySQL data, the feature is present
  on all Import Data dialogs (for Tables, Views and Procedures).
* Added the ability to specify character set and collation options for new schemas created through the
  Create New Schema action label and for new tables created through the Export Excel Data to New Table action
  label. By default schemas are created using the server default character set and collation, and tables are
  created using the schema ones just as previous Excel versions worked.
* Added a new Reset to Defaults button to the Import, Export or Append advanced options and Global Options
  dialogues to allow resetting options to their default values.
* Added new advanced option to display all allowed MySQL data types in the Export Data dialog's Data Type
  combo box versus only the basic and mostly used data types that have been shown in previous versions of
  MySQL for Excel.

Known Issues
--------------------
* Upgrading from versions 1.2.0 and lower is not possible due to a bug fixed in 1.2.1. In that scenario
  the version (1.2.0 or lower) must be uninstalled first. Upgrading from 1.2.1 works correctly.
* CTRL+A cannot be used to select all DB objects, SHIFT+arrow or click or CTRL+click must be used instead.
* Excel tables created from external data sources may not refresh if MySQL for Excel add-in is loaded.
* PivotTables are normally placed to the right (skipping one column) of the imported data, they will not be
  created if there is another existing Excel object at that position.



MySQL for Excel 1.2.1 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.2.1

* Optimized the way SQL statements are sent to the server, INSERT statements for Export Data
  operations are not sent anymore as single large statements but as single INSERT statements
  for each of the data rows. In average a 30-35% time improvement was achieved.
* Optimized the way SQL queries are created for a changed row (in average a 30-40% time
  improvement), the processing of warnings returned by the SQL server and the overall creation
  of result text for errors and warnings so processing is faster and less memory is used.
* Optimized how the Excel data is loaded into a MySqlDataTable object (in average a 80% time
  improvement), so now a temporary hidden Excel worksheet is used to prepare the data to be
  loaded and then load it after it was preprocesed instead of preprocessing cell by cell as it
  was done before. The preprocessing eliminates as many blank Excel cells as possible as well.
* Added an advanced option to the Insert Data dialog to create secondary indexes after all the
  data has been inserted, this saves a lot of disk I/O for bulk inserts (thousands of rows)
  since reindexing will not happen every time a row is inserted but only once at the very end
  of the data insertion. This option is enabled by default.
* Added an advanced option to the Append Data dialog to disable unique indexes and foreign keys
  temporarily for the duration of the data insertion. This option is disabled by default since
  the user must make sure that if unique indexes are present the data mapped to that column does
  not contain duplicate data.
* Removed the 'Remove columns that contain no data, otherwise just flag them as "Excluded"' option
  in the Advanced Export Data Options dialog so now empty columns in an Excel range selected for
  an Export Data or Append Data operations are always removed. This change helps when users select
  the whole worksheet's cells or whole rows/columns for exporting or appending data.
* Other bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).


MySQL for Excel 1.2.0 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.2.0

* Added support for edition of MySQL Workbench connections right from the Welcome Panel where
  connections are shown. Any of the listed MySQL Workbench connections can be right-clicked
  and a new "Edit Connection" context menu is available for users to edit the Workbench
  connection properties. There is no longer a need to have MySQL Workbench installed in order
  to edit an existing connection.
* Added support for optimistic updates to Edit Data operations via a configurable option, using
  optimistic updates will ensure that pushing changes in the current editing session does not
  overwrite changes done by another person to the set of data retrieved initially. This option
  can be set globally for all editing sessions open by the current user which is persisted in the
  settings file, or for a specific editing session so when the session is over the optimistic
  update value is reset to the global one.
* Changes done to the Advanced Options dialogues for Import, Export and Append Data forms are now
  immediately reflected without requiring to close and reopen those forms.
* Added "Preview SQL statements before they are sent to the server" and "Show executed SQL statements
  along with their results" global options. The first option lets users preview the SQL statements
  used in an Export, Append or Edit data operation before they are sent to the MySQL server and edit
  them if needed. The second option lets users apply the statements directly and show the executed
  SQL statements after they were applied along with the results of the operations.
* Added "Allow to save active editing sessions" global option. This allows to save Edit sessions
  when saving the Excel workbook, and restoring them when the workbook is opened again.
* Added the "Create an Excel table for the imported MySQL table data" option to the Import Data
  dialog's advanced options to automatically create an Excel table object for every MySQL table
  imported to Excel so it can be used for Excel data analysis. Additionally the user can override the
  default style for the Excel table and choose one of the available styles within a drop down list.
* Added a new informational label "Schema:" to the panel "Select a Database Object" that shows the
  name of the current schema, located just below the "User:" and "IP:" labels.
* Fixed code that was not detecting an Excel row deletion but instead was detecting an Excel row
  change during an Edit Data operation.


MySQL for Excel 1.1.2 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.1.2

* Upon saving a Workbook containing Worksheets in Edit Mode, the user is asked if he
  wants to exit the Edit Mode on all Worksheets before their parent Workbook is saved
  so the Worksheets are saved unprotected, otherwise the Worksheets will remain protected
  and the users will be able to unprotect them later retrieving the passkeys from the
  application log after closing MySQL for Excel.
* Added background coloring to the column names header row of an Import Data operation
  to have the same look as the one in an Edit Data operation (i.e. gray-ish background).
* Expired passwords are checked upon connection and can be reset by the users right at
  connection time within the add-in.
* A connection test is done before doing any operation against the MySQL Server (schema
  creation, data export, append, import and edition).
* Added global options to override the default connection and query execution timeouts.
* Connection passwords can be stored securely just like MySQL Workbench does and these
  secured passwords are shared with Workbench in the same way connections are.
* Fixed bug where a backslash was inserted before apostrophes when editing a MySQL table.
* Fixed problem specific to Excel 2013 where the add-in side bar was not visible on Excel
  windows different than the first window opened.
* Fixed problem where users different to the one that installed MySQL for Excel could not
  see and use the add-in (i.e. the add-in was only installed for the current user and not
  for all users).
* Fixed problem where a failed connection was always stating that the connection password
  was wrong, now the actual failing reason for the connection failure is shown.
* Other bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).


MySQL for Excel 1.1.1 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.1.1

* Added About dialog so users can check the MySQL for Excel version right from the Welcome panel.
* Fixed formatting of decimal numbers for European users where the decimal separator is a ",".
* Fixed formatting of data on Excel cells that had data previously imported on them.
* Other bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).
	

MySQL for Excel 1.1.0 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.1.0

* Edit MySQL Data
	This may be the coolest feature so far; users will be able to edit the data in a
	MySQL table using MS Excel in a very friendly and intuitive way.  Edit Data supports
	inserting new rows, deleting existing rows and updating existing data as easy as playing
	with data in an Excel’s spreadsheet and pushing changes back to the server.
* Bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).
	
Known Issues
--------------------
* The Edit Data does not lock records and does not update data in an optimistic way, so if
  data has changed by another user in the table being edited after it was pulled for edition
  it will be overwritten with the latest change.


MySQL for Excel 1.0.7 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.0.7

* Windows Authentication is now working for both proxy & non proxy scenarios,
  for proxy use the SQL receipt like this:
	CREATE USER myuser1 IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows as 
	'machine\\\\user1=foo_user' 
	create user foo_user identified by 'pass' 
	grant all privileges on *.* to 'foo_user'@'%' 
	grant proxy on foo_user to myuser1 

  while for non proxy use a SQL receipt like this
	CREATE USER myuser1 IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows as 'myuser1, Administrators'
	grant all privileges on *.* to 'myuser1'@'%'
  where myuser1 is supposed to be a member of the Windows Administrators group.
   
  In both cases you should be able to connect, Excel addin will still ask for the password, 
  just leave it blank.


MySQL for Excel 1.0 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.0

MySQL For Excel provides the following features:
* Integrates seamlessly with Excel 2007 and 2010
* Uses the MySQL Workbench connections you have already established
* Allows importing of data from MySQL into Excel spreadsheets
* Allows appending of Excel data onto existing MySQL tables
* Allows exporting of Excel data into new MySQL tables

Known Issues
--------------------
* Seamless sync of Workbench connections is not working in this release.  
  The connections you make in MySQL for Excel will not be available in Workbench.
* Export Data dialog's preview grid can truncate some column names
* Connections cannot be edited currently.  Please use MySQL Workbench to edit your connections
* Export Data dialog can change the name of an autoadded primary key when changing first row checkbox
* Windows Authentication only works with a proxy user, for example:
	the following script can be used to implement proxy scenario: 
	CREATE USER myuser1 IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows as 
	'machine\\\\user1=foo_user' 
	create user foo_user identified by 'pass' 
	grant all privileges on *.* to 'foo_user'@'%' 
	grant proxy on foo_user to myuser1 

Then, from MySql Excel addin, a connection can be created/opened by 
@ specifying user "myuser1" and no password (assuming windows current user is 
machine\\user1).
