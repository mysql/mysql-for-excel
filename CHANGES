1.3.2
- Added logic to only let the creation of a single PivotTable for the whole data model to be selectable when Excel relationships are being created and if and only if
  the Excel version is 2013 or higher.
- Fixed code that was always attempting to create Excel relationships even when the option for that was not set by users.
  (MySQL Bug #73402, Bug #19299550 - EXCEL RELATIONSHIPS CREATED EVEN IF THE OPTION FOR THAT IS UNCHECKED)
- Removed the reference to "views" wherever relationships are mentioned, since relationships only concern tables, not views.
  (MySQL Bug #73398, Bug #19296989 - CHANGE SOME TEXT REFERENCES REGARDING VIEWS RELATED TO IMPORT MULTIPLE OPERATION)
- Changed the placement of PivotTables for stored procedure result sets imported into Excel with an horizontal alignment, before these were placed below the imported
  data, now they are placed to the right of the data to avoid an error with refreshing the Excel tables tied to the PivotTables.
- Added a new context-menu option called "Add Related Tables" available only when right-clicking a table already present in the Related Tables list view. When this new
  option is clicked, all tables related to the right-clicked table one that have not been already included in the Related Tables list view will be added to it. These
  tables are unchecked (i.e. not selected for import) by default so they can be reviewed first and included manually.
- Corrected the logic that rules the Append Data action label to make it work correctly so that it is enabled in every case you are able to append data to a table.
  (MySQL Bug #73267, Bug #19190638 - APPEND DATA ACTION LABEL BECOMES UNAVAILABLE WHEN CHANGING DB OBJECT NODES)
- Added a new option to the context-menu of the schemas list (opened by right-clicking it) to display the default schema collation below their names, the option is
  disabled by default.
- Added code to check if PivotTables to be created for imported data would collide with an Excel object already in the importing worksheet, if so a dialog to import the
  data and the PivotTables into another worksheet will be shown. Also enhanced the way stored procedure result sets are laid out on a worksheet when all of them are
  imported horizontally or vertically and PivotTables are created for each result set, instead of just skipping one row or column, the necessary rows and columns are
  skipped so the created PivotTables for the result sets do not collide with each other.
- Changed every 'Session' reference in the application to 'Connection Information' to make the reference to these objects more accurate and less confusing.
- Removed saving step that created invalid connection information entries in the settings.config file even when the user chose not to save the workbook.
  (MySQL Bug #73319, Bug #19242130 - INVALID CONNECTION INFORMATION IS SAVED WITHOUT THE USER SAVING THE WORKBOOK)
- Fixed the import of stored procedure result sets into Excel tables (the import to Excel ranges was working), and more importantly implemented code that lets the Excel
  tables created from stored procedures to be refreshed by the user. (MySQL Bug# 73151, Bug #19129583 - IMPORT PROCEDURE IS NOT WORKING)
- Fixed a problem that arise when creating a new workbook without closing the Excel Addin Pane, making it impossible to import tables after that.
  (MySQL Bug #73263, Bug #19189185 - UNABLE TO IMPORT TABLES IN MYSQL FOR EXCEL UNDER WEIRD SCENARIO)
- Added a new combo box to the Import Multiple dialog to let users create one single PivotTable for all Excel tables in the active Workbook's data model, or to create a
  PivotTable for each of the imported tables or views, when importing multiple database objects. By default the option to create a single Pivot Table is selected when the
  "Create a PivotTable" checkbox is checked.
- Optimized code that creates Workbook connections so instead of always creating 2 connections for each created Excel table now 1 is created. A second Workbook connection
  is only created when creating Excel relationships for imported tables, that second connection is needed for Excel to create their corresponding Model Tables which are
  used to create each Excel relationship.
- Rewording of Restore Saved Edit Sessions and Import Sessions Missing Connections dialogs to make them more understandable.
- Added token validation at AfterSave event to ensure no reconnection information is saved when the workbook saving process is cancelled.
  (MySQL Bug #73192, Bug #19153978 - RECONNECTION INFO FOR EXCEL TABLES IS SAVED ALTHOUGH WORKBOOK SAVE IS CANCELLED)
- Rewrote the code that handles tables relationships in the Import Multiple dialog, relationships are detected for all tables imported to Excel (both the ones in the
  original selection from the DB objects selection panel and their related ones flagged by the user to be imported).  The relationships are now detected in 2 directions
  based on MySQL foreign keys and are created in the Excel model if the "Create Excel relationships for imported tables" option is available and checked.  Added code to
  present a dialog to the users showing relationships that could not be created because of errors found instead of outputting that to the application log. Enhanced the
  Import Multiple dialog to show all related tables for tables in the original selection as well as their related ones, so users can know in advance what Excel model
  relationships will be potentially created.
  (MySQL Bug #73191, Bug #19153946 - RELATIONSHIPS NOT CREATED FOR DB OBJECTS IN ORIGINAL SELECTION)
  (MySQL Bug #73193, Bug #19154006 - RELATED MYSQL TABLES AND VIEWS ARE DETECTED ONLY IN A SINGLE DIRECTION)
- Added validation to only enable the checkbox to Add Summary Fields when Excel Table Creation is enabled too.
  (MySQL Bug #73004, Bug #18979388 - ADD SUMMARY FIELDS ENABLED EVEN THOUGH EXCEL TABLE CREATION IS DISABLED)
- Added code to trigger WokbookAfterSave event handler on Excel 2007 since this version of Excel lacks the ability to trigger this event compared to later versions.
  This prevented Import and Edit Sessions from being saved correctly. (MySQL Bug #73182, Bug #19145707 - EDIT AND IMPORT SESSIONS ARE NOT SAVED IN OFFICE 2007 WIN7X64)
- Renamed the "Create an Excel table for the imported MySQL table data" advanced option in the Import Data dialogs to "Create an Excel table for the imported MySQL data"
  which is consistent to the fact that we can import not only tables but also views and procedures.
  (MySQL Bug #73003, Bug #18979352 - CREATE AN EXCEL TABLE FOR THE IMPORTED MYSQL TABLE DATA OPTION SHOULD BE RENAMED)

1.3.1
- Changed the type of custom ribbon for MySQL for Excel to use the XML Ribbon approach of the Excel fluent interface in order to be able to override the native
  functionality for the Refresh and Refresh All ribbon commands, which was not possible using the Visual Designer Ribbon approach.
  (MySQL Bug #72974, Bug #18962538 - ERROR WHEN CLICKING REFRESH ALL IN DATA TAB)
- When the user has created Import Sessions and saved the workbook, the connection these sessions are linked to can be deleted. When the workbook is reopened, these sessions
  had no way to be used any further. Now, a new dialog was created to prompt the user to create a new connection to replace the old one not found and be able to continue
  working with the same sessions afterwards. (MySQL Bug #72966, Bug #18961860 - PROMPT FOR CONNECTION CREATION IF NOT FOUND UPON IMPORT SESSION RESTORE)
- Set the AllowZeroDateTimeValues property value of connections created from stored Edit Sessions being restored to true so they support MySQL zero dates. Fixed also a
  bug preventing Edit Sessions from being restored when starting MySQL from Excel on an already opened Excel workbook.
  (MySQL Bug #72842, Bug #18889495 - SAVED EDIT DATA SESSIONS ARE NOT RESTORED IF DATA CONTAINS DATES)
- Enhanced the code that refreshes an Excel table to smartly resize it before binding it according to the new size of its data source. If the new size is bigger than
  before, new columns or rows will be inserted to make room for the new Excel table size. Added code to show errors to the user upon Excel tables or PivotTables creation.
  (MySQL Bug #72975, Bug #18962617 - IMPORT DOES NOT RETRIEVE DATA AT LEFT COLUMNS FROM A PREVIOUS IMPORT)
- Fixed an issue with Edit Connections in the Welcome Panel, where the selected connection information was not being populated in the Edit Connection Dialog.
  (MySQL Bug #72990, Bug #18968777 - EDIT EXISTING CONNECTIONS IS BROKEN)
- Fixed the formula applied in the temporary Excel range used to feed the export data for a new MySQL table, the formula now considers the value of the option "First row
  contains column names" in the Export Data dialog. (MySQL Bug #72973, Bug #18962470 - DUPLICATE ENTRY FOR AUTOGENERATED PRIMARY KEY COLUMN)
- Modified the way PivotTables are created to pass to the Excel native methods addresses in R1C1 notation rather than the actual range objects which works in all
  scenarios (even with big data). (MySQL Bug #72972, Bug #18962371 - PIVOT TABLE DIALOG NOT DISPLAYED FOR TABLES HOLDING LARGE DATA)
- Fixed new comparison method to detect the correspondent session's ListObjects by GUID, while also deleting invalid leftover objects.
  (MySQL Bug #72964, Bug #18961806 - FIX REFRESH PROBLEM WHEN USERS CHANGE EXCEL TABLE NAMES OF IMPORTED MYSQL DATA)
- Removed the Line and LinearRing types from the list of valid data types supported by the MySQL server, meaning the types do not appear anymore in the Data Type combo
  box located in the Export Data form and are not treated as valid if typed-in by the user. Line and LineaRing are not a part of the SFA-SQL nor SQL/MM-Spatial standards,
  thus not implemented in the MySQL Server. (MySQL Bug #72970, Bug #18962184 - DATA TYPE COMBO BOX IN EXPORT DATA DIALOG SHOWING 2 NON-WORKING SPATIAL TYPES)
- Fixed some conditions in the code that was preventing relationships for selected tables and views (multi-selection) to be processed, so related tables and views were
  not found and listed in the Multiple Import dialog. (MySQL Bug #72971, Bug #18962354 - NO TABLE RELATIONS DETECTED IN OFFICE 2007 AND 2010)
- Changed the way connections are created for Excel 2013, instead of creating a connection for an Excel command type we create a default command type one (like we do for
  Excel 2007 and 2010) which fixes this particular bug. (MySQL Bug #72976, Bug #18962670 - IMPORTING SAME TABLE TWICE FAILS AFTER DELETING EXCEL TABLE LINKED TO THE FIRST)
- Added new functionality to the Data Type combo box for Enum and Set types. When all data types are being shown in the Export Data dialog (via advanced option), if the
  user selects Enum or Set, the list of valid values for the type declaration is assembled automatically from the column's data so there is no need to type the list of
  values that goes between parenthesis manually.
- Fixed a bug in the Export Data dialog where data types containing parenthesis entered manually in the Data Type combo box for new columns were not validated correctly.
  (MySQL Bug #72970, Bug #18962214 - DATA TYPES ENTERED MANUALLY IN DATA TYPE COMBO BOX ARE NOT VALIDATED CORRECTLY.)
- Fixed a cosmetic problem on the graphical list of connections, schemas and database objects where the text of each list item turned bold when hovering the mouse over.
  (MySQL Bug #72968, Bug #18962130 - FIX PROBLEM WITH BOLD LETTERS IN MYSQLLISTVIEW.)
- Implemented the use of <CTRL>+<A> as a shortcut in the list of database objects to select all MySQL tables and views.
  (MySQL Bug #72963, Bug #18961544 - IMPLEMENT CTRL+A IN TREE-VIEW TO SELECT ALL TABLES AND VIEWS)

1.3.0
- Added new feature to allow the selection of multiple tables and views in the Database Objects panel, the multiple selection can be done by using the CTRL or SHIFT keys
  along with arrow keys, paging keys or mouse clicks. Clicking CTRL+A selects all tables and views in the panel. A new Import Multiple Tables and Views action appears with
  a multiple selection of DB objects, when clicked the data of all selected DB objects is imported into individual Excel worksheets, Excel tables are created optionally
  for each imported Table or View. On Excel 2013 (and higher) PowerPivot model relationships are created based on MySQL relationships defined with foreign key constraints.
- Added new feature to optionally display all allowed MySQL data types in the Export Data dialog's Data Type combo box versus only the basic and mostly used data types that
  have been shown in previous versions of MySQL for Excel.
- Added new feature to include a row with summary fields for imported MySQL data, the feature is present on all Import Data dialogues (for Tables, Views and Procedures).
- Added new feature to allow the specification of character set and collation options for new schemas created through the Create New Schema action label and for new
  tables created through the Export Excel Data to New Table action label.  By default schemas are created using the server default character set and collation, and tables
  are created using the schema ones just as previous Excel versions worked.
- Added new feature to create Excel PivotTables for imported data if specified by the users, the feature is present on all import operations (Tables, Views, Procedures).
  The PivotTables are created next to the imported data so users can customize the PivotTable to suit their needs.
- Added new feature to allow Excel tables created from imported MySQL data to be refreshed using Excel's Refresh commands. Saving an Excel Workbook where Excel tables
  were created from imported MySQL data will retain the connection properties so the data can be refreshed after closing and reopening the Workbook later.
- Added new feature that allows the user to reset option settings in Import, Export or Append advanced options and Global Options dialogues to their respective default values.

1.2.1
- Fixed a bug that happened after closing an Excel window containing an open MySQL for Excel add-in in Excel 2013, the custom task pane linked to the closed window was
  not being disposed of correctly and not removed from the collection of Excel task panes either.
  (Bug #18392674 - SEVERAL CLICKS NEEDED ON THE MYSQL FOR EXCEL RIBBON BUTTON TO START/CLOSE ADD-IN)
- Tables with Guid data are now imported correctly. Creation of the named tables is now working with Guid tables too.
  (Bug #17806468 - IMPORTING TABLES WITH GUID TO EXCEL - EXCEPTION)
- Fixed a bug in the MSIs present since version 1.1.2 that was trying to add Registry keys for MySQL for Excel during a product upgrade when the registry keys were
  already present and should not be added. The Registry keys are just added now when the product is installed for the first time.
  (Bug #18354533 - MYSQL FOR EXCELL ADDIN 1.2.0 (STAND ALONE) IS NOT ABLE TO UPDATE AN OLD VERSION)
- Fixed code that was causing the AutoPK column not to appear sometimes in the CREATE and INSERT statements, fixed the total count of inserted rows for Export Data and
  Append Data operations depending on the status of the "First Row Contains Column Names" checkbox. Fixed the starting value of the AutoPK column depending on the status
  of the "First Row Contains Column Names" checkbox.
  (Bug #18269654 - EXPORT DATA - ERROR ON CHANGING PRIMARY KEY OPTIONS)
- Changed functionality to always forcefully remove columns that contain no data. Empty columns will always be excluded now.
  (Bug #18113057 - EXPORT DATA: UNHANDLED EXCEPTION WHEN SELECTING THE WHOLE SPREADSHEEET'S DATA).
  (Bug #16501338 - EXPORT DATA - EMPTY COLUMNS ARE NOT ALWAYS FLAGGED AS EXCLUDED)
- Fixed code in the MySqlDataTable, MySqlDataColumn and MySqlDataRow classes that makes INSERT SQL queries recalculate after a column is excluded.
  (Bug #18269602 - EXPORT DATA - EXCLUDING COLUMNS CAUSE THE EXPORT DATA TO FAIL)
- Optimized INSERT statements which are now sent as single statements for each of the data rows. In average a 30-35% time improvement was achieved.
  Optimized the way SQL queries are created for a changed row (in average a 30-40% time improvement) so processing is faster and less memory is used.
  Optimized how the Excel data is loaded into a MySqlDataTable object (in average a 80% time improvement), so now a temporary hidden Excel worksheet is used to prepare
  the data to be loaded and then load it after it was preprocesed instead of preprocessing cell by cell as it was done before.
  Added an advanced option to the Insert Data dialog to create secondary indexes after all the data has been inserted, this saves a lot of disk I/O for bulk inserts
  (thousands of rows) since reindexing will not happen every time a row is inserted but only once at the very end of the data insertion. This option is enabled by default.
  Added an advanced option to the Append Data dialog to disable unique indexes and foreign keys temporarily for the duration of the data insertion. This option is
  disabled by default since the user must make sure that if unique indexes are present the data mapped to that column does not contain duplicate data.
  (Bug #17577014 - EXPORTING HUGE TABLE (250,000 ROWS) NEVER FINISH (SERVER LOST THE CONNECTION))
- Connector .NET, an internal component to MySQL for Excel fixed a bug that occurred when working with Unique keys, which caused this problem.
  (Bug #17891357 - ONLY ONE TABLE FROM A DATABASE WON'T IMPORT)
- Enabled MySQL for Excel to create default connections at startup for every MySQL service found locally when no default connections exist and MySQL Workbench
  is not installed. (Bug #16238788 - CONNECTIONS FOR FOUND MYSQL SERVICES SHOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY CREATED)
- New column mappings are selected by default when the user creates them.
  (Bug #17665496 - APPEND DATA - NEW STORED MAPPING NOT APPLIED AFTER CREATION)
- Changed the way the MySQL for Excel objects panel is refreshed on Windows XP.
  (Bug #16238484 - TABLE ICON IS CUTOFF ON THE TABLE LIST WHEN TABLE IS EXPORTED TO AN EMPTY SCHEMA)
- Implemented a new strategy for checking if a selection of Excel cells contain values to enable/disable the Export Data to New Table action label, this new
  strategy uses Excel native functions which are optimized for speed and memory usage. Optimized the way selected Excel data is fed to the Export Data's preview
  grid so the Export Data dialog loads faster with huge selections of data.
  (Bug #17349260 - ERROR WHEN SELECTING THE WHOLE SPREADSHEET'S CELLS)
  (Bug #14362824 - SELECTING A HUGE AMOUNT OF CELLS IN EXCEL FREEZES EXCEL)

1.2.0
- Added visual warnings to the Append Data dialog for source Excel columns being mapped to target MySQL columns where the source data is not suitable for the
  mapped target column's data type, so the user can make corrections before the data is attempted to be appended on the server.
- Added "Allow to save active editing sessions" global option. This will let users to save their opened edit sessions when saving the workbook, and restoring them
  by reopening the workbook.
- Added the "Create an Excel table for the imported MySQL table data" option to the Import Data dialog's advanced options to automatically create an Excel table
  object for every MySQL table imported to Excel so it can be used for Excel data analysis. Additionally the user can override the default style for the Excel
  table and choose one of the available styles displayed within a drop down list.
- Added a new label "Schema:" to the panel "Select a Database Object" that shows the name of the current schema, located just below the "User:" and "IP:" labels.
- Added "Preview SQL statements before they are sent to the server" and "Show executed SQL statements along with their results" global options. The first option
  lets users preview the SQL statements used in an Export, Append or Edit data operation before they are sent to the MySQL server and edit them if needed. The
  second option lets users apply the statements directly and show the executed SQL statements after they were applied along with the results of the operations.
- Fixed code that was not detecting an Excel row deletion but instead was detecting an Excel row change during an Edit Data operation.
  (Bug #17852774 - EDIT DATA - DELETING A ROW TRIGGERS A DATA CHANGE IN THE FOLLOWING ROW)
- Changes done to the Advanced Options dialogues for Import, Export and Append Data forms are immediately reflected without requiring to close and reopen those forms.
- Added support for optimistic updates to Edit Data operations via a configurable option, using optimistic updates will ensure that pushing changes in the current
  editing session does not overwrite changes done by another person to the set of data retrieved initially. This option can be set globally for all editing sessions
  open by the current user which is persisted in the settings file, or for a specific editing session so when the session is over the optimistic update value is
  reset to the global one.
- Added support for edition of MySQL Workbench connections right from the Welcome Panel where connections are shown. Any of the listed MySQL Workbench connections
  can be right-clicked and a new "Edit Connection" context menu is available for users to edit the Workbench connection properties.  This feature shines brighter
  when MySQL Workbench is not installed since users only relied on MySQL Workbench to edit a connection, without Workbench users had to delete a connection and
  create it again with updated values.

1.1.2
- Generate a password dynamically to protect Excel Worksheets during Edit Data operations instead of using a hardcoded GUID. If the user saves the Workbook while
  any of its Worksheets is in Edit mode, MySQL for Excel will ask the user if he wants to exit the Edit Mode before saving. If the user chooses not to close Edit
  Mode the passkeys used to protect those Worksheets will be output to the application log after closing MySQL for Excel.
- Set the color of the Excel cells containing column names from an Import Data operation to the same color used in Edit Data operations for consistency.
- Added a check on every connection test for an expired password, if the password has been expired a dialog is now shown to the user to reset the password. Also
  added a connection test before any operation against the database (schema creation, data import, append, export or edition).
  (Bug #17354118 - DON'T HANDLE EXPIRED PASSWORDS)
- Added code to escape text values to be imported to an Excel worksheet that start with an equals sign so Excel does not treat those values as formulas that will
  fail evaluation. This is an option turned on by default that can be turned off by users if they wish to import values to be treated as Excel formulas.
  (Bug #17354102 - ERROR IMPORTING TEXT VALUES TO EXCEL STARTING WITH AN EQUALS SIGN)
- Added code to properly check the reason for a failing connection, if it's a failing password the user gets a dialog to retry the connection with a different
  password until the connection succeeds, a connection error not related to the password is thrown or the user cancels. If the failing connection is not related
  to a bad password an error message is shown to the users indicating the reason of the failure.
  (Bug #16239007 - CONNECTIONS TO MYSQL SERVICES NOT RUNNING DISPLAY A WRONG PASSWORD ERROR MESSAGE)
- Added global options dialog that can be accessed from the Schema Selection and DB Object Selection panels where the timeouts for the connection to the DB
  Server and for the query commands can be changed from their default values (15 seconds for the connection timeout and 30 seconds for the query timeout).
  (MySQL Bug #68732, Bug #17191646 - QUERY TIMEOUT CANNOT BE ADJUSTED IN MYSQL FOR EXCEL)
- Changed the Varchar(65,535) data type shown in the Export Data data type combo box to Text since the maximum row size is 65,535 bytes and any autodetected
  column data type with a length greater than 4,000 should be set to Text actually for the table to be created successfully.
  (MySQL Bug #69779, Bug #17191633 - EXPORT FAILS FOR EXCEL FILES CONTAINING > 4000 CHARACTERS OF TEXT PER CELL)
- Removed code that was replacing all spaces typed by the user in an overriden data type for a new column in an Export Data operation, also improved the data
  type detection code to flag as invalid data types with parenthesis but without any text inside or where the contents inside the parenthesis are not valid for
  the specific data type. (Bug #17260260 - EXPORT DATA SET TYPE NOT WORKING WITH MEMBER VALUES CONTAINING SPACES)
- Added support for the year data type with a length of 2 or 4 and a validation that valid values are integers between 1901-2155 (for 4-digit years) or between
  0-99 (for 2-digit years). (Bug #17259915 - EXPORT DATA YEAR DATA TYPE NOT RECOGNIZED IF DECLARED WITH A DISPLAY WIDTH)
- Fixed code for Export Data operations where users overrode the data type for columns typing Text in the data type combobox, which is a valid data type but was
  not recognized as such. (Bug #17259490 - EXPORT DATA TEXT DATA TYPE NOT RECOGNIZED AS A VALID DATA TYPE)
- Changed the location of the registry where the MySQL for Excel add-in is installed to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE instead of HKEY_CURRENT_USER so the add-in is accessible
  by all users and not only to the user that installed it. For this to work with Excel 2007 a hotfix may be required (see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976477).
  (MySQL Bug #68746, Bug #16675992 - EXCEL-ADD-IN IS ONLY INSTALLED FOR USER ACCOUNT THAT THE INSTALLATION RUNS UNDER)
- Added support for Excel 2013 Single Document Interface, now that Excel 2013 creates 1 window per workbook also the Excel Add-In maintains an independent
  custom task pane in each window. Also changed the way the toggle button works, instead of just showing or hiding the Add-In it actually opens and closes it.
  (MySQL Bug #68792, Bug #17272087 - MYSQL FOR EXCEL SIDEBAR DOES NOT APPEAR IN EXCEL 2013 (WITH WORKAROUND))
- Included the latest MySQL Utility with a code fix for the COM exception thrown when attempting to open Workbench in the Manage Connections window.
  (Bug #17258966 - MYSQL WORKBENCH NOT OPENED BY CLICKING MANAGE CONNECTIONS HOTLABEL)
- Fixed code for Append Data operations that was not applying a calculated automatic mapping correctly when the source and target tables had different number of
  columns, some columns with the same name but some of those lying on column indexes beyond the limit of the other source/target table.
  (MySQL Bug #69220, Bug #17278349	 APPEND DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY DETECT EXCEL COL HEADER WITH SAME NAME AS SQL FIELD)
- Fixed some code for Edit Data operations that was escaping special characters twice (during edition in Excel and then upon sending the query to the MySQL server).
  (MySQL Bug #68669, Bug #17271693 - A BACKSLASH IS INSERTED BEFORE AN APOSTROPHE EDITING TABLE WITH MYSQL FOR EXCEL)
- Refactored all code to comply with SyleCop rules, upgraded MySQL Utility with latest version that encapsulates dialog base classes and introduces more classes
  to handle Workbench connections, and removed these from the Excel project. (Bug #16500331 - CAN'T DELETE CONNECTIONS CREATED WITHIN ADDIN)

1.1.1
- Added code to check for changes on the contents of the currently selected Excel cells, so if the contents become empty the Export and Append data actions are
  disabled in the same way as they are disabled when a new cells selection is made and they contain no data.
  (Bug #16495151 - EXPORT TABLE LINK IS NOT DISABLED WHEN DATA IS DELETED)
- Added code to clear the format of a target Excel range where MySQL data is to be imported to before copying the values to the Excel range so the format applied
  to the Excel cells from a previous import operation does not corrupt the format of newly imported data.
  (Bug #16495155 - DATA GETS CORRUPTED WHEN CELL FORMAT IS DIFFERENT THAN DATA EXPORTED)
- Fixed logic that detects data types for columns to check for empty columns instead of excluded ones and properly assigning the default generic data type of
  varchar(255) to empty columns as per design. (Bug #16495493 - EXPORT DATA - DATA TYPE FOR EMPTY COLUMNS IS NOT AUTO-DETECTED)
- Fixed code that detected data types for columns for the scenario where only 1 row of Excel data is selected for Export or for Append, in which case the data
  type was always being set as a varchar(255) which is used when data types between rows are not consistent. (Bug #16493139 - AUTOMATIC MAPPING NOT WORKING)
- Added a parameter to the LoadConnections method that refreshes connections from its corresponding file, set to true when the the Refresh Connections action
  is performed. (Bug #16493129 - CONNECTION DETAILS NOT REFRESHED)
- Added code to prevent the connections, schemas and DB objects lists from drawing while they are being filled with items.
  (Bug #16392862 - CONNECTIONS LIST FLICKERS WHEN A CONNECTION IS DELETED OR ADDED)
- Added performance_schema to the list of system schemas, so now it shows along with the mysql and information_schema schemas list.
  (Bug #16473033 - PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA NOT LISTED UNDER "SYSTEM SCHEMAS" GROUP)
- Added code that converts numbers to invariant culture strings when building the SQL statements used to push queries to the MySQL Server.
  (MySql bug #67663, Bug #15903921 - USING MYSQL FOR EXCEL IN FRANCE)
- Refactored code in Panels (AutoStyleableBasePanel.cs, DBObjectSelectionPanel.cs, SchemaSelectionPanel.cs, WelcomePanel.cs), in TaskPanelControl.cs and in 
  some Forms (ExportForm.cs, ImportTableViewForm.cs) to comply with StyleCop rules.
- Removed code that always forced the FirstDisplayedScrollingColumnIndex of the preview grid to the currently selected column every time the First Row Contains
  Column Names checkbox is checked or unchecked. (Bug #16419402 - EXPORT DATA FREEZES WHEN SWITCHING HEADERS ROW)
- Set the CreateIndex property value in each new column to be exported immediately after the column data type's is auto-detected.
  (Bug #16238445 - EXPORT DATA - CREATE INDEX CHECKBOX IS NOT AUTO-CHECKED ON DATATYPE DETECTION)
- Moved logic that handles Table and Column values and warnings from Export Form (frontend) to MySQLDataTable and MySQLDataColumn classes (backend).
  (Bug #16397637 - EXPORT DATA - FOCUS GOES TO FIRST COLUMN WHEN EXCLUDING ANY OTHER COLUMN)
- Added code to expand each of the connection group nodes after they are initialized with existing connections.
  (Bug #16238782 - REMOTE CONNECTIONS SHOULD BE EXPANDED ON THE WELCOME PANEL)
- The context menu opened by right-clicking the preview grid in the Import Data Form is now showing context menu actions depending on the number of selected columns
  as follows:
    Select All: Visible when # of selected columns < total columns
    Select None: Visible when # of selected columns > 0
  (Bug #16238663 - IMPORT DATA - CONTEXT MENU SHOULD SMARTLY SHOW SELECT ACTIONS)
- Removed the code that disabled the whole preview grid when the Import Form was used within an Edit Data operation, the disabling of the preview grid was disabling
  the horizontal scrollbar as well. Now the grid is not disabled but columns selection in the grid is cancelled when the Import Form is used by Edit Data which was
  the original intention since in Edit Data all columns must be imported to the worksheet. Disabled the context menu for the grid as well in this scenario.
  (Bug #16239011 - EDIT DATA - IMPORT DIALOG'S PREVIEW GRID HAS HORIZONTAL SCROLLBAR DISABLED)
- Added a link in the Welcome Panel to open an About box displaying the MySQLfor Excel version and copyright text. The About box can be closed by clicking on it or
  pressing the ESC key.(Bug #16238860 - MYSQL FOR EXCEL VERSION NOT VISIBLE UNLESS GOING TO ADD/REMOVE PROGRAMS)

  1.1.0
- Added Edit MySQL Data feature: users are now able to edit the data in a MySQL table using MS Excel in a very friendly and intuitive way. Edit Data supports
  inserting new rows, deleting existing rows and updating existing data as easy as playing with data in an Excel’s spreadsheet and pushing changes back to the server.
- Enabled the following checkboxes in the Append Data's Advanced Options dialog and added code in the Append Data dialog to use the checkboxes as follows:
  * Automatically store the column mapping for the given table
    - If checked the current mapping will be stored automatically after clicking the Append button if the append operation is successful and there is no mapping for
	  the current connection.schema.table already; the new mapping is stored with a proposed name of Mapping.
  * Reload stored column mapping for the selected table automatically
    - If checked the first Stored Mapping found where all column names in the source grid match all column names in the target grid is automatically selected and
	  applied when the Append Data dialog is loaded.
- Fixed code that applies a stored column mapping to skip target columns where the associated mapping is empty (saved as a -1).
- Enclosed the Add-In's startup code in a try-catch block in order to log any possible error thrown during startup; and added information messages to the log at the
  begginning of the Add-In's startup code and at the end of the shutdown code.  Also changed the wrapper method that calls the MySQLUtility to write messages to the
  log to make logging easier, thus changed the log call throughout all the code that contains a try-catch block.
- Added code to the main wix configuration file to check if a newer version is already installad and if so abort the installtion.
- Fixed code to refresh the Import Procedure Form's preview grid's data source to repaint its contents every time the Call button is pressed.
- Added code to re-pull connections after connections are migrated from Excel to Workbench.
- Fixed code so when the Append Data's Automatic Mapping is performed any subsequent change on a mapping resets the mapping to a Manual Mapping.
- Added code to the InfoDialog class to set the button text to "Show Details" or "Hide Details" depending on the status of the Details text container.
- Fixed a GUID in the main wix configuration file so now previous versions are uninstalled during a new installation.
- Added an option to the Export Data's Advanced Options dialog to remove columns with no data, by default the Export Dialog will only flag those columns as Excluded.
  Added code to display a warning and paint a column red if the column name is not set, display a warning if the table name is not set, and stack warnings but not
  display them if a column is Excluded, warnings are displayed normally for columns if they are not Excluded anymore.  Added code to prevent the Append and Export of
  Data if more than 1 selection is made (selecting more than 1 area holding the Ctrl key while selecting Excel cells).
- Fixed problem that prevented MySQL for Excel from loading when Display settings in Windows 7 is set to Adjust to Best Performance
  (Oracle bug 14521405 - UNHANDLED EXCEPTION IS THROWN WHEN LOADING MYSQL FOR EXCEL).
- Fixed code that renames the auto-generated Primary Key column when the Table name changes since it was not detecting if a column with the same name already existed
  in the table. The column duplication was not actually happening, it looked that way because the automatically generated PK column was not detecting a column had
  that same name.
- Fixed code to always set an empty string instead of null to the MySQLDataColumn properties that stores MySQL data types (MySQLDataType, RowsFrom1stDataType and
  RowsFrom2ndDataType). Added code to display a warning and color red a column which Data Type has not been set by the user or has been manually cleared.
- Added code to output to the application log exception messages consistently in all places where exceptions are catched.

1.0.7
- Changed code to conditionally detect the datatype of a column with no data in any of its cells as either a Varchar(255) when Exporting data (empty column falls back to a "safe"
  type that user can override) or as a null/empty datatype when Appending data so the empty column can be automatically mapped to any other column regardless of the target's
  column datatype. (Internal bug 35 - Append Data detects a column with no data as a varchar column which does not map to any column).
- Updated code so that when Workbench version 5.2.41 or earlier is installed and there are still no connections created in MySQL for Excel the Workbench connections are copied
  from Workbench to the MySQL for Excel connections file. (Internal bug 49 - Workbench connections are not copied to MySql for Excel).
- Updated version in AssemblyInfo to 1.0.7.
- Manage Connections action label is available in the Welcome Panel when MySQL Workbench 5.2.42 is installed.
  Database connections are shared with MySQL Workbench if version 5.2.42 or later is installed (meaning they are read from and saved to the Workbench connections file and on the
  first run of MySQL for Excel it will attempt to migrate all local connections to the Workbench connection file and delete the local connections file, otherwise they are still
  managed locally within MySQL for Excel. (Oracle bug 14368158 - CONNECTIONS CREATED IN MYSQL FOR EXCEL UNUSABLE IN WORKBENCH)
- Refactoring on TransparentPictureBox control to fix some flickering when resizing the Excel form.
  Added an upperPanel that contains all controls above the MyTreeView controls to all panels so when the form is resized to have a very small size the controls at the bottom
  actually go behind the new upperPanel so there is no overlapping at all. (Oracle bug 14406412 - OVERLAPPING CONTROLS ON ALL PANELS WHEN EXCEL WINDOW IS SMALL).
- Removed the code that reset the TaskPaneControl's height since the height can't be changed for a right-docking of the panel.
  (Oracle bug 14369568 - EXCEL WINDOW CAN'T BE RESIZED IF STARTS WITH A SMALL SIZE).
- Fixed code in custom PreviewDataViewGrid control to readjust the recalculation of the headers width when the HeaderText changes and to disable the AutoWidth feature of each
  column header when the automatically recalculated width exceeds the ColumnsMaximumWidth property. (Oracle Bug 14350168 - EXPORT DATA DIALOG'S PREVIEW GRID TRUNCATES COLUMN NAMES)
- Fixed code so now "text" columns can be automatically mapped to set or enum columns.
  Fixed code to properly change mapped column names when checking/unchecking the "First Row Contains Column Names" checkbox in the Append Data Form.
  (Oracle Bug 14370049 - THE AUTO MAPPING IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY)
- Disabled Export button when table name is empty (Oracle Bug 14389853 - EXPORT BUTTON IS ENABLED WHEN TABLE NAME IS EMPTY)
